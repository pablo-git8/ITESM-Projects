# ITESM Projects Pablo Ruiz Lopez

Welcome to my repository, which serves as a showcase of various projects I undertook or contributed to during my bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering at the Instituto Tecnológico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM), Mexico City Campus, between 2012 and 2017.

This repository also includes projects from my international study program at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea.

Please note that the content displayed here is intended solely for demonstration purposes. It doesn't include detailed code or algorithms, and most projects are documented in Spanish. Should you require more in-depth information on the source codes of any project, or if you're interested in English translations of the papers, feel free to contact me at pablo.devdt@gmail.com.

# Brief Description of Projects

## 1. Lie Detector Based on Bio signals and MRI Scans

This project involved developing an algorithm and data cleaning procedures for a lie detection system based on various biopotentials (EKG, EEG, Respiratory Rate, and EDA), measured using BIOPAC Biosensors, alongside MRI (3T) scans in .TIFF format.

For the processing of biosensor readings and dynamic MRI images, I utilized a range of technologies, including the BIOPAC Suite, G-Tech OpenVibe Software, and MATLAB. The project also involved experimental acquisition and the use of MATLAB for GUI development.

## 2. Medical DICOM Image Processing GUI

I developed a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) using MATLAB and Simulink, designed for processing medical DICOM images. This GUI facilitates various image processing functions, enabling users to efficiently handle tasks such as loading and manipulating grayscale images, applying Prewitt filters, executing edge processing, and other fundamental image processing operations. This tool aims to streamline the workflow for medical image analysis, offering a practical and intuitive interface for both educational and professional applications in the field of medical imaging.

## 3. Typing with Your Mind (Collaboration)

In this collaborative project, we successfully customized and trained models using OpenVibe G-Tech software to create a remarkable user interface. This interface, after extensive training and under specific experimental conditions, enabled users to type letters and numbers on a PC by simply focusing their gaze on a displayed matrix.

The core principle driving this project was the detection of the P300 bio-potential, which was achieved through EEG readings. The implementation involved intricate logic and a thorough understanding of EEG data interpretation, allowing us to harness the P300 signal – a specific brainwave response – to translate visual focus into direct digital input. This project stands as a testament to the potential of neuroengineering in enhancing human-computer interaction.

## 5. Ultrasonic-Based System for Assisting Blind People Motion

Developed both hardware and software systems that consist of mounting an ultrasonic sensor in a wearable hardware implementation to assist blind people to detect borders or edges. 

This project (prototype) was developed using Assembler for programming ATMEGA microcontrollers. For the hardware implementation we built the microcontroller board and programmer as well.

## 6. Cardiovascular Monitor Instrumentation Device

In this project we developed a heart monitoring system capable of measuring the heart rate, calculate different peaks in the EKG signal and measure different parameters in the heart noises signal.

The technologies used for this project were BIOPAC bio-sensors, MATLAB programing and customized digital and analog circuits.
