# ITESM Projects Pablo Ruiz Lopez

## Context

This is a repository storing some of the projects I developed or collaborated during my bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering in Instituto Tecnologico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM) Mexico City Campus during 2012-2017. 

In here I have also available some projects made during my international study abroad program in Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. 

The information showed in the repo is quite limited and it is only for showing purposes, there is no code or algorithms included and most of these projects are in Spanish. If you would like to have deeper insights on source codes in any of the project or to have the English version of the papers, please contact me at pabloweb8@gmail.com

## Brief Description of The Projects

- [x] Lie Detector Based on Bio signals and MRI Scans

Developed an algorithm and data cleaning procedures for lie detection based on bio-potentials measured (EKG, EEG, Respiratory Rate and EDA) using BIOPAC Biosensors reading and MRI Scans. 

Biosensors readings and MRI dynamic images processing were made by using different technologies like BIOPAC Suite, G-Tech OpenVibe Software and MATLAB. Experimental acquisition and protocols were used using MATLAB GUI development as well.

- [x] Medical DICOM Image Processing GUI

Developed a GUI using MATLAB and Simulink that can processes images loaded on it and allow the user to perform basic image processing operations like loading grayscale processing, Prewit filters, edge processing, among others.

- [x] Ultrasonic-Based System for Assisting Blind People Motion

Developed both hardware and software systems that consist of mounting an ultrasonic sensor in a wearable hardware implementation to assist blind people to detect borders or edges. 

This project (prototype) was developed using Assembler for programming ATMEGA microcontrollers. For the hardware implementation we built the microcontroller board and programmer as well.

- [x] Music Magic Fingers (Awarded 2014)

Developed musical instrument that allow people to play different notes by pressing different fingers and moving the hand in different directions. The technologies used for this project were Arduino One developer board, C programming and Arduino musical libraries, accelerometers, and customized digital and analog electronics.

- [x] Cardiovascular Monitor Instrumentation Device

In this project we developed a heart monitoring system capable of measuring the heart rate, calculate different peaks in the EKG signal and measure different parameters in the heart noises signal.

The technologies used for this project were BIOPAC bio-sensors, MATLAB programing and customized digital and analog circuits.

- [x] Typing with Your Mind

In this collaboration, we were able to customize and train models in OpenVibe G-Tech software that allowed the user (after thorough training and specific experimental conditions) to type letters and numbers in the PC by just staring at one matrix displayed. 

The logic and implementation behind this project were the P300 bio-potential detection by an EEG reading.

- [x] Amplatzer Implant Blood Simulation

This project consisted in designing a structure similar to the heart and modeling flows before and after an Amplatzer implant. The technologies used for this project were CAD designs mainly.

- [x] Sound Equalizer

Developed a basic sound equalizer using customized analog circuits.
